The cpp files in each folder is executed in vivado HLS 2019 software to generate synthesis report.
RTL is exported to generated IP driver files including contraint files
The IP blocks are generated from the IP Files and integrated in the vivado design software to implement the YOLOv8 IP architecture block design.
The IP block design is further synthesized and implemented on a targeted FPGA board to evaluate the resource utilization and power consumption.
The IP block design and the performances achieved are shown in
